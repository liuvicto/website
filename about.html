								<p>Growing up in Sacramento, my curiosity about the intricacies of the world was ignited. Guided by the values instilled by my parents, I developed a deep concern for the well-being of both humanity and the environment. To contribute meaningfully, I took up my first challenge by engaging in volunteer work within my local community as a teenager, working with organizations like Soil Born Farms, while also extending my efforts to the vibrant Los Angeles Community once I got to university. During this exploration, I discovered a profound interest in technological ethics and the inner workings of businesses. And as a result, I eagerly pursued a path that led me to USC, where I study Economics, complemented by minors in Business Finance and Innovation: A Digital Entrepreneurship.</p>
								<p>As of right now, I am an inspiring Product Manager with focuses in marketing and strategy. I love to constantly think on my feet, and am extremely analytically driven. Continuously mastering my skills in Figma, Jira, Python, HTML/CSS, R/Stata, and Excel. More to come.</p>
								<p>Currently Obsessed with 
								<ul>
									<li>TV Shows (Better Call Saul, Succession) </li>
									<li>Sacramento Kings (offseason moves?)</li>
									<li>Filming and Podcasting</li>
									<li>Writing (primarily non-fiction or simply jotting!)</li>
								</ul></p>
